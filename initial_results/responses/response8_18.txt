Predicting an individual voter's opinion on corporate profits based on their location and voting method is not possible, as residents of any given area, including Skamania, Washington, hold a wide range of perspectives. Public opinion on this issue generally falls into two categories:

*   **Business corporations make too much profit:** Proponents of this view often point to the significant gap between executive compensation and worker wages, suggesting that profits are generated at the expense of employees and consumers. They may also argue that high profit margins in consolidated industries reflect a lack of competition and can lead to increased prices for essential goods and services.

*   **Most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit:** Proponents of this view typically argue that profit is a necessary incentive for innovation, risk-taking, and investment. They may point out that corporate earnings allow for the creation of jobs, the development of new technologies, and the provision of returns to shareholders, which include millions of individual investors and pension funds. They often emphasize that profit is a sign of a company’s efficiency and health in a competitive market.
