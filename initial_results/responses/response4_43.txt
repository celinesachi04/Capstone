Predicting whether a specific voter will choose a third-party candidate based on limited demographic information is complex, and political scientists suggest that multiple factors influence such a decision.

### Factors Influencing Third-Party Voting

*   **Political Climate and Dissatisfaction:** Voters often turn to third parties when they feel that neither major party represents their interests or when they are dissatisfied with the major-party candidates. This sentiment can fluctuate significantly from one election cycle to the next.
*   **Geographic Trends:** Grant County, Washington, historically leans toward the Republican Party in presidential elections. While third-party candidates occasionally perform better in specific regions, their overall vote share in Washington state has historically been small. In the 2020 election, for example, third-party and write-in candidates received around 3-4% of the vote statewide.
*   **Voting Method:** Research into "return methods" (such as mail-in voting) generally focuses on turnout rates rather than candidate choice. In Washington, all elections are conducted primarily by mail, so this method is standard across all political affiliations in the state.
*   **Demographic Limitations:** Age and gender are often used to identify broad voting trends, but they are not definitive predictors of individual behavior. Without specific information on a voter’s past behavior, party affiliation, or policy priorities, it is difficult to determine their likelihood of deviating from the major parties.

Ultimately, whether a voter chooses a third-party candidate depends on individual ideology, the specific candidates on the ballot, and the overall political environment at the time of the election. Consequently, there is no consensus or factual basis to determine a "yes" or "no" answer for an individual case.
