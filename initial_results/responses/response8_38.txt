It is not possible to determine an individual's specific opinion on corporate profits based on their gender, location, or the method they use to return a ballot. People's views on economic issues are shaped by a wide range of personal experiences, values, and political beliefs.

While public opinion polls may show trends within certain demographic groups, there is no consensus on this topic. Individuals in any given area—including Klickitat, Washington—hold a diverse array of perspectives. Some believe that business corporations make too much profit, while others believe that most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount. Because of this diversity of thought, picking one option for a specific voter would be an unfounded generalization.
