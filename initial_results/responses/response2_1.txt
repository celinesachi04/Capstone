**Yes.**

**Reasoning:**
While gender (male) statistically leans Republican in recent U.S. elections, the geographic and procedural data points strongly toward a Democratic lean:
1.  **Location:** Island County, Washington, is a Democratic-leaning county. In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won the county by nearly 12 percentage points (54.4% to 42.6%).
2.  **State Context:** Washington is a reliably "blue" state.
3.  **Return Method:** In states with universal mail-in voting like Washington, voters who use drop boxes or "other" non-traditional return methods (as opposed to standard mail or day-of) have statistically trended more Democratic in recent cycles. 

While individual votes vary, the statistical likelihood for a voter in this specific location favors the Democratic candidate.
