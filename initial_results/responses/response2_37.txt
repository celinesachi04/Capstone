Predicting how an individual will vote based on demographic data involves weighing several conflicting factors, and it is not possible to provide a definitive "yes" or "no" answer.

*   **Location:** Lincoln County, Washington, is a heavily Republican area. In the 2020 presidential election, the Republican candidate received over 70% of the vote in this county. Geographic location is often one of the strongest predictors of voting behavior.
*   **Gender:** Nationally, female voters have trended toward the Democratic Party in recent decades. In 2020, a majority of women voted for the Democratic candidate, though a significant minority (approximately 44%) voted for the Republican candidate.
*   **Return Method:** In recent election cycles, mail-in voting has been used more frequently by Democratic voters than by Republican voters. However, mail-in voting has historically been used by voters of both parties, particularly in states like Washington that have long-established vote-by-mail systems.

Because this voter has characteristics associated with both parties—living in a strongly Republican county while belonging to a demographic and using a voting method that has recently leaned Democratic—there is no consensus on how they might vote. Individual political preferences are influenced by many factors beyond these broad categories, such as specific policy concerns, candidate appeal, and personal values.
