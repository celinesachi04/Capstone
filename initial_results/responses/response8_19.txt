Determining an individual's specific viewpoint on corporate profits based solely on their location and voting method is not possible, as political and economic opinions vary significantly across all demographics and regions.

In the United States, including in places like Whatcom County, Washington, there are two primary perspectives on this issue:

**Business corporations make too much profit**
Those who hold this view often point to increasing wealth inequality and the rising cost of living. They may argue that high profits are sometimes achieved through practices that disadvantage workers, such as maintaining low wages or reducing benefits. Proponents of this view might also suggest that large corporations use their market power to keep prices high for consumers or that they do not pay a fair share in taxes compared to the public infrastructure and services they utilize.

**Most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit**
Those who hold this view often argue that profit is a necessary incentive for innovation, investment, and economic growth. They may point out that profits allow companies to expand, create jobs, and develop new technologies that benefit society. From this perspective, corporate profits are seen as a reward for taking financial risks and successfully meeting consumer demand in a competitive marketplace. Additionally, many people benefit from corporate profits through retirement funds, 401(k)s, and other investments held by a large portion of the population.
