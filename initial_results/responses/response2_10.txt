Predicting how an individual will vote based on limited demographic information is not possible with certainty. Several factors provide conflicting indicators for this voter:

*   **Location:** Wahkiakum County is a rural area that has historically leaned Republican. In the 2020 presidential election, the county voted for the Republican candidate by a margin of approximately 17 percentage points.
*   **Gender:** Historically, women in the United States have been more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than men. National exit polls from 2020 showed women favoring the Democratic candidate by about 11 to 15 points.
*   **Method and Age:** The "other" return method and the lack of age data provide no significant statistical direction.

Because the demographic leanings of the location (Republican) and the gender (Democratic) often offset each other in rural areas, and because individual choices are influenced by many personal factors, it is impossible to provide a "yes" or "no" answer.
