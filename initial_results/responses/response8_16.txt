An individual's perspective on corporate profits cannot be determined based on their location or voting method. In King County, Washington—as in any region—voters hold diverse viewpoints on economic issues.

*   **Business corporations make too much profit:** This viewpoint is often supported by concerns over wealth inequality, high consumer prices, and the belief that corporate interests exert too much influence over public policy. Proponents of this view may point to record corporate earnings as evidence that profits are being prioritized over fair wages or consumer affordability.
*   **Most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit:** This perspective is often based on the idea that profits are essential for a healthy economy, as they drive innovation, allow for business expansion, and create jobs. Supporters often highlight that many people benefit from corporate profits through pension funds, retirement accounts, and stock market investments.

Because personal political and economic beliefs are shaped by a wide range of factors beyond geography, it is not possible to pick one stance for this voter.
