Here's a prediction of who each voter would support, based on the provided data. This is a complex task with limited information, so the predictions are based on general trends and assumptions. I'll aim to minimize "unknown" responses, but will use it when there's truly insufficient data.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Younger Voters (18-24):** Lean towards progressive candidates.
*   **Older Voters (65+):** Lean towards conservative candidates.
*   **Higher Education/Income:** Tend to lean progressive.
*   **Race/Ethnicity:**  While generalizations are dangerous, some trends exist. Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino voters tend to lean Democratic. Asian voters are diverse but leaning Democratic. Native American/Alaska Native voters often lean Democratic. White voters are more divided.
*   **Religion:**  Jewish voters tend to lean Democratic. Christian voters are more divided. Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist voters lean Democratic. None/Agnostic/Atheist voters lean Democratic.
*   **Marital Status/Family Size:** Single/never married and smaller families lean progressive. Married with larger families lean conservative.
*   **Urbanicity:** Urban voters lean progressive, rural voters lean conservative.
*   **Gender:** Female voters lean progressive, male voters are more divided.
*   **Nonbinary/Unspecified Gender:** Lean progressive.
