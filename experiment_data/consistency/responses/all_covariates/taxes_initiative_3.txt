Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the description of Initiative Measure No. 2109.  The reasoning is explained after the list.  I've used "unknown" sparingly, only when there's truly insufficient information to make a reasonable guess.

**Reasoning:**

The initiative repeals a tax on high capital gains, which would reduce funding for education.  Here's how I interpreted the data to predict votes:

*   **Income:** Voters with higher incomes (>$25k) are more likely to benefit from the tax repeal and therefore more likely to vote "yes". However, the initiative *decreases* funding for education, which is a strong counter-argument. I prioritized the education funding aspect.
*   **Education:** Voters with higher education levels (bachelor's, graduate/professional) are generally more informed and may be more concerned about the impact on education, leading to a "no" vote.
*   **Age:** Older voters (65+) might be more concerned about the long-term effects on education and public services, leaning towards "no".
*   **Race/Ethnicity:** While I avoided making broad generalizations, some groups historically prioritize social programs and education, which would lead to a "no" vote.
*   **Religion:**  I did not find a strong correlation between religion and voting preference in this context.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  When multiple key data points are "prefer not to say," I defaulted to "no" as a conservative estimate, assuming a general preference for maintaining education funding.
*   **Urbanicity:** Urban voters may be more likely to support public funding for education.
*   **Marital Status/Number of Kids:** Voters with children are more likely to prioritize education funding.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Limited Data:** This is a very simplified model based on limited data. Real-world voting behavior is far more complex.
*   **Assumptions:** I made several assumptions about how different demographic groups would weigh the pros and cons of the initiative.
*   **No Causation:** Correlation does not equal causation. The observed relationships in the data may not be causal.
*   **Political Leaning:** The data does not provide any information about the voters' political affiliations, which would be a crucial factor in a real-world prediction.
