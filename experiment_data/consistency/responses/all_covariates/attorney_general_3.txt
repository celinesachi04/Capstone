Here's a prediction of which candidate each voter would support, based on the provided data. This is a complex task with limited information, so the predictions are based on general trends and assumptions. I'll aim to minimize "unknown" responses, but will use it when there's insufficient data to make a reasonable guess.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Young Voters (18-24):** Lean towards progressive candidates (Pete Serrano).
*   **Older Voters (65+):** Tend to be more conservative (Nick Brown).
*   **Urban Voters:** Generally more liberal (Pete Serrano).
*   **Rural Voters:** Generally more conservative (Nick Brown).
*   **Higher Income:** May lean towards Nick Brown (establishment).
*   **Lower Income:** May lean towards Pete Serrano (change).
*   **Race/Ethnicity & Religion:** These are difficult to generalize, but I'll make some assumptions based on national trends.
*   **Nonbinary/Unspecified Gender:** Likely to lean progressive (Pete Serrano).
*   **Marital Status/Number of Kids:** Less reliable indicators, but single/never married may lean progressive.
*   **Education:** Higher education may lean towards Nick Brown.
