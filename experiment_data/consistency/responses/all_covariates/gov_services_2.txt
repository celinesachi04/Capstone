Here's a prediction of each voter's preference (A or B) based on the provided data.  The reasoning is based on common correlations (though these are generalizations and not definitive):

*   **Younger voters (18-24):** Tend to lean towards bigger government (B) due to expectations of social programs and future benefits.
*   **Higher Income ($100k+):**  Often favor smaller government (A) due to lower reliance on government services and concerns about taxes.
*   **Lower Income (<$25k):**  Generally prefer bigger government (B) for social safety nets.
*   **Rural Voters:**  Can lean either way, but sometimes favor smaller government (A) due to self-reliance.
*   **Urban Voters:**  Tend to favor bigger government (B) due to reliance on public services.
*   **Education Level:** Higher education can correlate with both, depending on field and political views.
*   **Religion:**  Difficult to generalize, but some religions have more collectivist views (leaning towards B).
*   **Marital Status/Kids:**  Families may lean towards B for support programs.
*   **Race/Ethnicity:**  Historically, some groups have leaned towards one side or the other, but this is highly variable and should be used cautiously.
*   **Nonbinary/Unspecified Gender:** Difficult to predict, leaning towards unknown.
