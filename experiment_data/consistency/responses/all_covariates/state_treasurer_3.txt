Here's a prediction of which candidate each voter would support, based on the provided data. This is a complex task, and the predictions are based on general trends and assumptions about how different demographics might vote in this election.  I'll use "unknown" sparingly, only when the data provides very little signal.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Limited Data:** This prediction relies *solely* on the provided voter data. Real-world voting behavior is influenced by many more factors (candidate platforms, current events, etc.).
*   **Assumptions:** I'm making assumptions about how different demographic groups lean politically in Washington State. These are generalizations and may not hold true for every individual.
*   **No Polling Data:** I have no access to polling data or information about the candidates' positions.
*   **State Treasurer Race Specifics:** I have no information about the specific issues in the State Treasurer race.
