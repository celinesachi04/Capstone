Here's a prediction of how each voter would likely vote, based on the provided data and general voting patterns.  It's important to remember this is an *estimation* and real-world voting is complex. I'm leaning towards Maria Cantwell (the incumbent Democrat) for most voters, but will consider factors like age, income, and stated religion/affiliation.  I will use "unknown" sparingly, only when the data is truly insufficient to make a reasonable guess.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Washington State Politics:** Washington is generally a Democratic-leaning state.
*   **Incumbency:** Maria Cantwell is the incumbent, which gives her an advantage.
*   **Limited Data:** This prediction is based on a very limited dataset. Many other factors influence voting decisions.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  I've interpreted "Prefer not to say" responses as neutral or leaning towards the incumbent (Cantwell) in most cases, but this is an assumption.
*   **Generalizations:** I've made generalizations based on demographic groups (e.g., younger voters leaning Democratic, higher income voters potentially leaning Republican). These are not always accurate.
*   **Religion:** I've used religion as a very rough indicator, recognizing that it's not a definitive predictor of voting behavior.
