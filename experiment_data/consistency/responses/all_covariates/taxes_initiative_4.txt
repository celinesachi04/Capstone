Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the description of Initiative Measure No. 2109.  The reasoning is explained after the list.  I've used "unknown" sparingly, only when there's truly insufficient information to make a reasonable guess.

**Reasoning:**

The initiative repeals a tax on high capital gains, which primarily affects wealthier individuals. The consequence is reduced funding for education.  Here's how I interpreted the data to make predictions:

*   **Income:** Voters with higher incomes ($75k+) are *more likely* to benefit from the tax repeal and therefore vote "yes". However, the initiative *reduces* education funding, which is a strong counter-argument. I prioritized the education funding aspect, assuming most voters value education.
*   **Education:** Voters with higher education levels (bachelor's, graduate/professional) are generally more informed and may be more likely to understand the long-term consequences of reduced education funding, leaning towards "no".
*   **Age:** Younger voters (18-24) are more likely to be impacted by changes to education funding, potentially leaning towards "no".
*   **Race/Ethnicity:** While I avoided making broad generalizations, some groups may have stronger ties to public education systems, influencing their vote.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  For voters who consistently select "Prefer not to say" for multiple categories, it's difficult to infer their position. I defaulted to "no" in most cases, assuming a slight lean against tax cuts that harm public services.
*   **Religion/Political Affiliation:** These are not provided, so I cannot use them.
*   **Urbanicity/Marital Status/Number of Kids:** These are less directly relevant but can provide some context.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This is a prediction:** It's based on limited data and assumptions. Real-world voting behavior is complex.
*   **Oversimplification:** The data is simplified, and many other factors influence voting decisions.
*   **Bias:** My own biases could unintentionally influence the predictions.
*   **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The data doesn't contain strong indicators of political leaning, making it difficult to predict with high accuracy.
