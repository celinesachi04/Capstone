Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the description of Initiative Measure No. 2117.  The reasoning is explained below the predictions.  I will use "unknown" sparingly, only when there's truly no basis for a prediction.

**Reasoning:**

This is a complex issue. Generally:

*   **Environmental Concerns:** Voters who identify with religions emphasizing stewardship of the earth (like some interpretations of Sikhism, Buddhism, and potentially Hinduism) might lean towards *no* (opposing the measure).
*   **Economic Concerns/Distrust of Government:** Voters who are widowed, divorced, or "prefer not to say" on religion might be more focused on economic impacts or distrustful of government programs, potentially leaning towards *yes* (supporting the measure).
*   **Family Status:**  Those with more kids might be more concerned about the economic impact of decreased funding for programs.
*   **"Prefer not to say"**: These voters are the hardest to predict. I'll lean towards a slight *yes* bias, assuming a general skepticism towards new taxes/programs.
*   **Religion:** Voters identifying with "none/agnostic/atheist" are harder to predict, but may lean towards *no* due to environmental concerns.
*   **Partnered/Married:** These voters may lean towards *yes* due to economic concerns.
