Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and general trends (recognizing this is a highly speculative exercise without more context).  I'll aim to minimize "unknown" but use it when the data is truly uninformative.  The logic is based on these assumptions:

*   **"Prefer not to say" on religion:**  Indicates a lack of strong affiliation, potentially leaning towards independent thought and thus, third-party consideration.
*   **Non-traditional marital status (separated, divorced, partnered):**  May indicate dissatisfaction with the status quo, potentially extending to political views.
*   **Smaller/Non-mainstream Religions (Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Other):**  May correlate with a willingness to consider alternatives outside the mainstream.
*   **None/Agnostic/Atheist:** Often associated with independent thinking.
*   **Number of Kids:** Less directly predictive, but larger families *might* be slightly more conservative.
*   **Widowed/Married/Single:** These are less strong indicators on their own.
