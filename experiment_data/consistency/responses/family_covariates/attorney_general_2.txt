Here's a prediction of who each voter would support, based on the provided data and general voting patterns.  It's important to remember this is a *highly* speculative exercise, as many factors influence voting decisions. I'm making assumptions based on correlations between demographics and likely political leanings.  I'll lean towards "unknown" when the data is too sparse to make a reasonable guess.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Married/Partnered, Religious:** Generally lean towards Nick Brown (more conservative).
*   **Single/Never Married, Younger, No Religion:** Generally lean towards Pete Serrano (more progressive).
*   **Divorced/Separated/Widowed:** More unpredictable, leaning slightly towards Nick Brown.
*   **"Prefer not to say"**:  Difficult to predict, leaning towards unknown.
*   **Number of Kids:**  Less directly predictive, but larger families *may* lean slightly conservative.
*   **Specific Religions:** Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish tend to lean Democratic, but with variations. Muslim is a diverse group. Christian is more varied, but generally leans conservative.
*   **None/Agnostic/Atheist:** Strongly lean towards Pete Serrano.
