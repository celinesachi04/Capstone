Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the description of Initiative Measure No. 2117.  The reasoning is explained below the predictions.  I will use "unknown" sparingly, only when there's truly no basis for a prediction.

**Reasoning:**

This is a complex issue. Generally:

*   **Environmental Concerns:** Voters who identify with religions emphasizing stewardship of the earth (like some interpretations of Sikhism, Buddhism, and potentially Hinduism) or who explicitly state "none/agnostic/atheist" (often correlating with science-based thinking) might lean *against* the measure (vote "no").
*   **Economic Concerns/Distrust of Government:** Voters who are widowed, divorced, or separated might be more focused on economic stability and less on long-term environmental goals. Those who "prefer not to say" on religion might also be more skeptical of government intervention. These voters might lean *for* the measure (vote "yes").
*   **Family Size:** Larger families (4+ kids) might be more concerned about the economic impact of increased costs due to environmental regulations.
*   **Marital Status:** Married voters might be more conservative and less likely to support environmental regulations that could impact the economy.
*   **Religion:** Jewish voters may lean against the measure. Muslim voters may lean for the measure. Christian voters are more split.
