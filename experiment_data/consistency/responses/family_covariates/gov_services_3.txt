Here's a prediction of each voter's preference (A or B) based on the provided data.  It's important to remember this is a *highly* speculative exercise, as the data provides no direct information about political leanings. The reasoning is detailed below the predictions.

**Reasoning:**

I'm basing the predictions on the following (admittedly weak) correlations:

*   **Marital Status:** Widowed/Divorced individuals *might* lean towards more government services (B) due to potential reliance on social safety nets. Partnered/Married individuals *might* lean towards less government (A). Separated individuals are harder to predict.
*   **Number of Kids:** More kids *might* correlate with a desire for more government support for families (B).
*   **Religion:**  This is the trickiest. I'm making broad generalizations (which are likely inaccurate) based on common stereotypes.  "Prefer not to say" and "None/Agnostic/Atheist" are treated as leaning towards less government (A).  More traditional religions are treated as potentially leaning towards more government (B).
*   **"Prefer not to say"**: These are generally marked as "unknown" as there is no information to base a prediction on.

**Disclaimer:**  These predictions are based on very limited and potentially misleading data. They should *not* be taken as accurate representations of anyone's actual political beliefs.  The "unknown" responses are used sparingly, but are appropriate for many cases given the lack of information.
