Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the initiative description.  I'm making educated guesses based on correlations (which may not be accurate in reality!).  I'll prioritize marital status, religion, and number of kids as indicators, with "Prefer not to say" generally leading to "unknown".  I'll use "unknown" sparingly, as requested.

**Assumptions & Reasoning:**

*   **Widowed/Older Voters:**  May be more resistant to change and potentially favor maintaining existing energy sources (natural gas).  Likely "yes".
*   **Married Voters:**  Generally more conservative, potentially leaning towards maintaining existing infrastructure. Likely "yes".
*   **Single/Never Married/Younger Voters:**  May be more open to change and electrification. Likely "no".
*   **Divorced/Separated/Partnered:** More difficult to predict, leaning towards "unknown" unless other factors are strong.
*   **Religion:**
    *   **Sikh/Hindu/Buddhist:**  Generally less politically defined in this context, leaning towards "unknown".
    *   **Jewish:**  May lean towards supporting regulations and future-proofing (electrification). Likely "no".
    *   **Christian:**  More varied, but potentially leaning towards maintaining existing systems. Likely "yes".
    *   **Muslim:**  More varied, leaning towards "unknown".
    *   **None/Agnostic/Atheist:**  Likely to favor scientific/future-oriented approaches (electrification). Likely "no".
*   **Number of Kids:**  More kids might mean a greater concern for affordability (potentially favoring natural gas).
