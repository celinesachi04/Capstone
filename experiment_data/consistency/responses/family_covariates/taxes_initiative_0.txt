Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach predicting votes, followed by the predictions for each voter.  This is a complex task, as I have no information about political leanings. I will base my predictions on reasonable assumptions about how demographic factors *might* correlate with support for or opposition to a tax repeal that impacts education funding.

**Assumptions & Reasoning:**

*   **Marital Status & Family Size:**  Married individuals and those with children are more likely to be concerned about long-term funding for education.  Those widowed or single/never married might be less directly impacted.
*   **Religion:** This is tricky.  Generally, more conservative religions *might* lean towards lower taxes, but this is a broad generalization.  I'll treat "Prefer not to say" as neutral.
*   **"Prefer not to say" responses:** I will treat these as *unknown* as there is no information to base a prediction on.
*   **Tax Impact:** The measure *decreases* funding for education.  I assume voters who prioritize education will vote "no".
*   **Capital Gains:** The tax applies to high earners ($250,000+ gains). I assume those who are likely to be affected by this tax (and thus benefit from its repeal) might vote "yes". However, without income data, this is a weak signal.

**Important Disclaimer:**  These predictions are based on limited data and assumptions.  Real-world voting behavior is far more complex. This is an exercise in applying logic to a dataset, not a reliable forecast of actual election results.
