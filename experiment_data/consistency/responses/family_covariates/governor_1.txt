**Important Considerations:**

*   **"Prefer not to say"**:  These are treated as 'unknown' as there's no basis for prediction.
*   **Religion**: While some religions have general political leanings, it's not a definitive predictor.
*   **Marital Status/Kids**: These are included in the data but have less direct predictive power without more context.
*   **Washington State Politics**:  Washington State leans Democratic, which influences the overall predictions.
*   **2024 Election**: This is a prediction for a specific election, and dynamics can change.
