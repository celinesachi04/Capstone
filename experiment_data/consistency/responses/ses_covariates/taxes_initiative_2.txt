Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and the initiative description. The logic prioritizes income as the strongest indicator, then education, and defaults to "unknown" when data is insufficient.  I'll aim for minimal "unknown" responses.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Higher Income = More likely to vote "yes"**:  Repealing a capital gains tax primarily benefits those with high capital gains (>$250k).
*   **Higher Education = More likely to vote "no"**: Those with higher education are more likely to understand and value public funding for education.
*   **"Prefer not to say" = Neutral/Unknown**:  These voters provide little information.
*   **Lower Income = More likely to vote "no"**:  Those with lower incomes are more likely to rely on public services funded by taxes.

Here are the predictions:
