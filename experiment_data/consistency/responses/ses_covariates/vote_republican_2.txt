Okay, I will analyze the voter data and predict their likely vote in the next U.S. presidential election, responding with "yes" or "no" (representing a likely vote for a major party - I'll assume "yes" for one and "no" for the other).  I will use "unknown" *very* sparingly, only when the data provides absolutely no basis for a reasonable guess.  I'll base my predictions on general trends associating education and income with voting patterns.  Higher education and income generally correlate with one party, while lower education and income correlate with the other. "Prefer not to say" will be treated as neutral and will lean towards "unknown".
