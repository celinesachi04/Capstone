Okay, I will analyze the voter data and predict their likely stance on the profit question (A or B).  I'll base this on the general correlation between education/income and views on corporate profits.  Here's the logic I'll use:

*   **Higher Education & Higher Income:** Generally correlate with a belief that corporations *are* making a fair profit (B).  This is because these voters are more likely to be involved in or benefit from the corporate world.
*   **Lower Education & Lower Income:** Generally correlate with a belief that corporations make *too much* profit (A).  These voters may feel exploited by large corporations.
*   **"Prefer not to say" (Education/Income):**  These are harder to predict. I'll lean towards "unknown" unless other factors suggest a strong leaning.
*   **Middle Education/Income:** These are the most difficult to predict and will often be marked as "unknown".

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This is a prediction.**  It's based on generalizations and correlations. Individual voters may have views that don't fit these patterns.
*   **Limited Data:**  I only have education and income. Other factors (age, location, political affiliation, etc.) would significantly improve accuracy.
*   **"Unknown" is used when there's insufficient information to make a reasonable guess.** I've tried to use it sparingly, but it's necessary for many "prefer not to say" cases and those with mixed indicators.
