Okay, I will analyze the voter data and predict their likely stance on the profit question (A or B).  I'll base this on the general correlation between education/income and views on corporate profits.  Here's the logic I'll use:

*   **Higher Education & Higher Income:** Generally correlate with a belief that corporations *are* making a fair profit (B).  This is because these voters are more likely to be part of the corporate structure, understand market forces, or believe in the benefits of a capitalist system.
*   **Lower Education & Lower Income:** Generally correlate with a belief that corporations make *too much* profit (A). These voters may feel exploited by large corporations or believe profits should be redistributed.
*   **"Prefer not to say" (Education/Income):**  These are harder to predict. I'll lean towards "unknown" unless other factors suggest a strong leaning.
*   **Middle Education/Middle Income:** These are the most difficult to predict and will often be marked as "unknown".

Here's the prediction for each voter, based on the provided data.  I will try to minimize "unknown" but use it when necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This is a prediction.**  It's based on generalizations and correlations. Individual voters may have views that don't fit these patterns.
*   **Limited Data:**  I only have education and income. Other factors (age, location, political affiliation, etc.) would significantly improve accuracy.
*   **"Prefer not to say" is truly unknown:**  I've tried to be conservative with "unknown" but it's the most honest answer when information is missing.
*   **Nuance:** The question itself is nuanced.  "Too much profit" and "fair and reasonable" are subjective.
