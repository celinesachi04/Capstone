Here's a prediction of voting preference based on the provided data, leaning heavily on income and education as proxies for voting behavior.  It's important to remember this is a *highly* speculative exercise without knowing the candidates' platforms or actual voter preferences. I'm making assumptions based on general trends.  I will use "unknown" sparingly, only when the data is truly ambiguous.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Higher Education & Income:** Generally lean towards Dave Larson (more conservative).
*   **Lower Education & Income:** Generally lean towards Sal Mungia (more progressive).
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  More difficult to predict, will lean towards "unknown" unless other factors are strong.
*   **HS/GED:** Split leaning slightly towards Sal Mungia.
*   **Some College:** Split leaning slightly towards Sal Mungia.
