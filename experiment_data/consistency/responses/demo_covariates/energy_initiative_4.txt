Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and a general understanding of how demographics *might* lean on energy/environmental issues.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end!**  I'm aiming for "yes" or "no" as requested, with "unknown" used very sparingly.  The reasoning is complex and relies on assumptions, so treat this as a thought experiment.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a *highly speculative* exercise.  I have made numerous assumptions based on broad demographic trends and the nature of the initiative.  Here's what influences these predictions and why they are likely inaccurate:

*   **Limited Data:** We only have race, age, gender, and urbanicity.  Many other factors are far more important (income, homeownership, political affiliation, environmental concerns, etc.).
*   **Generalizations:**  I'm relying on generalizations about how different groups *might* vote. These are often wrong.
*   **Issue Complexity:** Energy policy is complex. People's views aren't solely determined by demographics.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  These voters are impossible to predict without more information. I've defaulted to "unknown" where appropriate.
*   **Nonbinary Gender:** I have no basis for predicting how gender identity influences voting on this issue.
*   **Urbanicity nuance:** Suburban voters can lean either way.
*   **No Political Affiliation:** The biggest missing piece of information.



**This should not be used for any real-world prediction or analysis.** It's an illustration of how one might attempt to make predictions with very limited data, and a demonstration of how unreliable those predictions are likely to be.
