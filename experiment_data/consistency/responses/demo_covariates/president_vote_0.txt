Okay, I will analyze the provided voter data and predict their presidential vote in the 2024 election, returning only the first name of the candidate.  Given the limited data, these are *predictions* based on general demographic trends and are not guaranteed to be accurate. I will use "unknown" sparingly, primarily for voters with "Prefer not to say" for race and/or limited other information.

Here's the breakdown, voter ID by voter ID:

1.  **Donald** (White, 18-24, urban - leaning towards a populist message)
2.  **Joe** (Black/African American, 65+, rural - traditionally Democratic)
3.  **unknown** (Other, 18-24, urban - too little information)
4.  **Joe** (Native American/Alaska Native, 45-54, urban - leaning Democratic)
5.  **Donald** (Prefer not to say, 55-64, urban - could go either way, leaning Trump)
