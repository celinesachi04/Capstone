Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach predicting votes, followed by the predictions for each voter.  I'll aim for "yes" or "no" based on likely voter tendencies, and use "unknown" *very* sparingly.

**Reasoning & Assumptions:**

*   **Tax Repeal & Funding Cuts:** This initiative *repeals a tax on high earners* and *reduces funding for education*. This is a complex issue.
*   **Likely "No" Voters:**  Those who generally support public funding for education, progressive taxation, and social programs are likely to vote "no." This includes younger voters, those identifying as nonbinary, and those from groups historically benefiting from public programs.
*   **Likely "Yes" Voters:** Those who favor lower taxes, believe in limited government spending, and may be higher earners are likely to vote "yes."
*   **"Prefer not to say" & Unspecified:** These are harder to predict. I'll lean towards "unknown" unless other factors suggest a strong leaning.
*   **Age:** Younger voters (18-24) are often more supportive of social programs. Older voters (65+) may be more concerned about taxes.
*   **Race/Ethnicity:**  While generalizations are dangerous, some groups have historically leaned towards certain political positions. I'll use this cautiously.
*   **Urbanicity:** Urban voters tend to be more liberal, while rural voters tend to be more conservative.
*   **Gender:** I will not assume gender influences voting preference.
