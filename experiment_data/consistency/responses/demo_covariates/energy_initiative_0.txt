Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and a general understanding of how demographics *might* lean on energy/environmental issues.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end!**  I'm aiming for "yes" or "no" as requested, with "unknown" used very sparingly.  The reasoning is complex and relies on assumptions, so treat this as a thought experiment.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a *highly speculative* exercise.  I have made numerous assumptions based on broad demographic trends and the nature of the initiative.  Here's what influences these predictions and why they should be taken with extreme caution:

*   **Limited Data:** We only have race, age, gender, and urbanicity.  Many other factors (income, education, political affiliation, specific concerns about energy costs, environmental values, etc.) are far more important.
*   **Generalizations:** I'm relying on generalizations about how different groups *might* vote. These generalizations are often inaccurate and can be harmful.
*   **Initiative Complexity:** The initiative itself is complex.  Voters may interpret it differently.
*   **"Unknown" Sparingly:** I tried to avoid "unknown" as requested, but in many cases, it would be the most honest answer.
*   **No Causation:** This is *not* saying that race or age *causes* someone to vote a certain way. It's simply a prediction based on the limited data provided.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** Predicting individual votes based on demographics is ethically problematic. This is purely for the purpose of fulfilling the prompt's request and demonstrating how such a task might be attempted (and its inherent flaws).
