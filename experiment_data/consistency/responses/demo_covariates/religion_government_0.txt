Here's a breakdown of the predictions, assigning 'A' or 'B' based on the provided data.  It's important to remember this is a *very* rough estimation based on limited demographic information.  I'll aim to minimize "unknown" but will use it when there's truly no basis for a prediction.

**Key Assumptions & Reasoning:**

*   **Younger Voters (18-24, 25-34):** Tend to lean towards separation of church and state (A).
*   **Older Voters (65+):**  May be more likely to favor policies supporting religious values (B), but this is a generalization.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  Difficult to predict; leaning towards A as a default.
*   **Race/Ethnicity:**  I'm avoiding making assumptions based on race/ethnicity as it's unreliable and potentially biased.
*   **Gender/Nonbinary:**  I'm avoiding making assumptions based on gender identity.
*   **Urban/Rural/Suburban:** Urban areas often correlate with more secular views (A), while rural areas may have stronger religious ties (B).
*   **Multiracial/Other:** Difficult to predict, leaning towards A.
