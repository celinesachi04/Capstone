Here's a breakdown of how each voter might respond to Initiative Measure No. 2109, with a "yes" or "no" prediction.  I'm basing this on likely correlations between demographics and tax/education funding preferences.  I will use "unknown" sparingly, only when there's truly no basis for a prediction.  I'll also explain the reasoning behind some of the predictions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Simplification:** This is a complex issue, and voter behavior is rarely predictable. This is a simplified model.
*   **Assumptions:** I'm making assumptions about how different groups generally view taxes and education funding.
*   **"Prefer not to say":**  These are the hardest to predict. I'll lean towards "unknown" for these.
*   **Nonbinary Gender:** I'm not assuming any specific political leaning based on gender identity.
