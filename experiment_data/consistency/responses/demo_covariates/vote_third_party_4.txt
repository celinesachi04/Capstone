Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and general trends (recognizing this is highly speculative without more information). I'll aim to use "unknown" sparingly, prioritizing a "yes" or "no" based on potential third-party leanings.  I'm basing this on the following assumptions:

*   **Younger Voters (18-24):** More open to third parties.
*   **Nonbinary/Unspecified Gender:**  May be less aligned with traditional party structures.
*   **"Prefer not to say" Race:** Could indicate dissatisfaction with the major parties.
*   **Rural Voters:** Generally more conservative, less likely to vote third party.
*   **Urban Voters:** More diverse, potentially more open to third parties.
*   **Certain Racial/Ethnic Groups:** Some groups have historically shown more support for third parties (though this is a generalization).
*   **Age (65+):** Generally more set in their political views, less likely to switch.
