Okay, I will analyze the provided voter data and predict their presidential vote in the 2024 election, returning only the first name of the candidate.  Given the limited data, these are *predictions* based on general demographic trends and are not guaranteed to be accurate. I will use "unknown" sparingly, primarily for voters with "Prefer not to say" for race and limited other information.

Here's the breakdown, voter ID by voter ID:

**Important Disclaimer:**  This is a speculative exercise. Real-world voting behavior is far more complex and influenced by many factors not present in this dataset.  I have made generalizations based on common demographic voting patterns, but these are not guarantees.
