Here's a prediction for each voter, based on the provided data and a general understanding of how demographics *might* lean on a tax issue impacting education funding.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end!**  I'm aiming for a reasonable, but simplified, approach.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a *highly* speculative exercise.  I've made the following assumptions:

*   **Age & Taxes:** Older voters (65+) are more likely to support repealing a capital gains tax (potentially having more capital assets).
*   **Age & Education Funding:** Younger voters (18-34) and those with families are more likely to prioritize education funding.
*   **Gender:**  I've assumed a slight tendency for females to lean towards supporting education funding.
*   **Unknown/Other:**  I've used "unknown" sparingly, primarily for voters with "Unknown/Other" gender, as their preference is truly unpredictable based on the given data.
*   **County:** I have not factored in county-level political leanings, as that information isn't provided in a way that allows for accurate prediction.
*   **Capital Gains:** I'm assuming voters affected by the tax (those with high capital gains) would vote to repeal it.
*   **Simplification:** This is a massive oversimplification of voter behavior. Many factors influence voting decisions.



**This is not a reliable prediction of actual voting outcomes.** It's an illustration of how one might attempt to apply basic demographic reasoning to a political issue.
