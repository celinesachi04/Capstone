Okay, I will analyze the voter data and predict the likely party affiliation for each voter.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Age:** Younger voters (18-24, 25-34) tend to lean Democrat. Older voters (65+) tend to lean Republican.
*   **Gender:** Women generally lean Democrat, while men are more divided.
*   **County:**  I have no specific county-level political data, so I'm relying on broader trends.
*   **"Unknown/Other" Gender:**  I've marked these as "unknown" as there's no clear indication of party preference.
*   **Generalizations:** These are *generalizations*. Individual voters may deviate significantly from these trends.
