Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach predicting votes on Initiative Measure No. 2124, followed by the predictions for each voter.  I'll aim for "yes" or "no" as the sole output, with "unknown" used *very* sparingly.

**Understanding the Initiative & Voter Profiles**

*   **The Initiative:** This is a complex issue about long-term care insurance. It essentially allows people to opt-out of a state-run program, potentially decreasing its funding.  This leans conservative/pro-choice (in the sense of individual choice regarding insurance).
*   **Voter Profiles:** I'll use the provided data (county, age, gender) to make educated guesses. Here's how I'll weigh the factors:
    *   **Age:** Older voters (65+) are *more likely* to be concerned about long-term care and *potentially* support the program (leaning "no"). Younger voters (18-34) might be less focused on this issue and more open to opting out (leaning "yes"). Middle-aged voters (35-54) are harder to predict.
    *   **Gender:**  Generally, women are more likely to support social safety nets like long-term care (leaning "no").
    *   **County:** This is the hardest to interpret without more data. I'll assume more rural counties (Yakima, Spokane, etc.) might lean more conservative ("yes"), while King County (more urban/liberal) might lean "no".  I'll treat others as neutral.
    *   **Unknown/Other Gender:** I will mark these as "unknown".

**Important Disclaimer:**  These are *predictions* based on limited data and generalizations. Actual voting behavior is far more complex. I have tried to be consistent in applying the logic described above.
